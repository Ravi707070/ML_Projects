# 🧠 Machine Learning Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly machine learning projects. These projects are built to strengthen my understanding of fundamental ML concepts and techniques. Below is a short description of each completed project along with a technical overview.

📧 Email Spam Detection
🔍 Description:
Classifies emails as spam or ham using text classification techniques. Demonstrates how NLP and ML can be applied to filter unwanted emails.

⚙️ Technical Synopsis:

Dataset: SpamAssassin (Ham and Spam samples)

Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF

Algorithms: Naive Bayes, SVM

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

Result: Achieved high spam/ham classification accuracy

🎬 Movie Recommendation System
🔍 Description:
Recommends movies based on users' historical ratings using collaborative filtering.

⚙️ Technical Synopsis:

Dataset: MovieLens

Preprocessing: User-item interaction matrix creation

Approach: Collaborative Filtering (SVD)

Evaluation: RMSE, MAE

Result: Delivered personalized recommendations

💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
🔍 Description:
Detects fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection and classification.

⚙️ Technical Synopsis:

Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset

Preprocessing: Data normalization, class imbalance handling (SMOTE)

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Isolation Forest

Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score (focus on recall due to fraud rarity)

Result: Effective identification of fraud cases

🌼 Flower Classification
🔍 Description:
Classifies images of flowers into categories using computer vision and deep learning.

⚙️ Technical Synopsis:

Dataset: TensorFlow Flowers dataset

Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, data augmentation
